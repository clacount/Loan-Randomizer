# LendingFair

## Provided for internal testing and security review only.

This is a simple local web app for assigning loans to loan officers using fair random distribution.

## Customer-facing documentation
- Pilot/customer documentation lives in `docs/customer/`.
- Start with `docs/customer/GETTING_STARTED.md`.
- Basic customers can use `docs/customer/BASIC_USER_GUIDE.md`.
- Pro customers can use `docs/customer/PRO_USER_GUIDE.md`.
- Methodology, implementation, limitations, and pilot QA checklists are also included in that folder.

## Release readiness checks
- Run automated guardrails with `node --test test/*.test.js`.
- Run a browser syntax check with `find src test -name '*.js' -exec node --check {} \;`.
- Use `docs/customer/PILOT_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` before packaging a Basic or Pro pilot build.
- The checklist covers customer mode, tier locking, simulation limits, PDF generation, CSV persistence, duplicate loan prevention, report metadata, internal-control hiding, and known-limitations review.

## How to use
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open `LendingFair Launcher.html` in a current version of Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
3. Click **Connect Working Folder** and pick the parent folder where monthly loan-randomizer data should be saved.
4. The app automatically creates/uses a monthly subfolder in `YYYY-MM` format (for example, `2026-04`) and reads `loan-randomizer-running-totals.csv` from that month.
5. If the CSV does not exist yet for the active month, the app creates it and you can enter the initial loan officers manually.
6. On supported browsers, the app remembers your approved folder and tries to reconnect on next launch so you do not have to pick it each time.
7. Enter each loan application number or ID, its **Amount Requested**, and its **Loan Type**.
8. Click **Run Fair Assignment**.

Each run creates a PDF named like `Loan-Assignment-Report-2026-04-14-091530.pdf` in the active monthly `YYYY-MM` subfolder. The PDF includes the timestamp, the total loan officers and loans entered, plus both **Assignments by Loan** and **Assignments by Officer** so managers can review every run.

The app also keeps a CSV state file named `loan-randomizer-running-totals.csv` in that same monthly subfolder. It stores running totals by officer, including loan count, dollar amount, and loan types already assigned, so the next run can keep balancing from prior history and restore the loan officer list when the app is reopened.

## Rule behavior
- You can use **any number of loan officers**.
- You must have **at least 1 loan officer**.
- Each loan is assigned to **one** officer.
- Each loan must have a type of **Auto**, **Personal**, **Credit Card**, or **Collateralized**.
- Each loan should include an **Amount Requested**.
- **Credit Card** loans are tracked by unit count and type, but their dollar amounts do not count toward goal-dollar balancing.
- The app groups loans by type and **shuffles each type separately**.
- Then it assigns each type in **random fair rounds**:
  - everyone gets one Auto before anyone gets a second Auto
  - everyone gets one Personal before anyone gets a second Personal
  - everyone gets one Credit Card before anyone gets a second Credit Card
  - everyone gets one Collateralized before anyone gets a second Collateralized
  - and so on within each type
- Within each type, the app compares a **balanced fairness score** that blends type distribution, goal-dollar distribution, and loan-count distribution, then chooses the assignment that leaves the team most even overall.
- Running totals are loaded from the CSV state file before each assignment so fairness can continue across multiple sessions instead of only the current screen.
- Officers who are missing from a single day's run are still kept in the CSV history so their prior totals are not lost.
- Fairness comparisons are normalized by each officer's **active sessions**, so someone returning from vacation is not automatically pushed into aggressive catch-up assignments.

## Examples
- **1 loan, 3 officers**: the single loan goes to one random officer.
- **2 loans, 3 officers**: two different officers get one each.
- **4 Auto loans, 4 officers**: each officer gets one Auto loan.
- **5 Personal loans, 2 officers**: one officer gets 3 Personal and the other gets 2 Personal, at random.
- **3 Auto, 1 Credit Card, 1 Collateralized with 3 officers**: each officer gets one Auto first, then the Credit Card and Collateralized loans go to two different officers because the app favors the lightest total load.
- **3 Auto loans of different sizes**: the larger Auto requests are placed first so the dollar totals stay as even as possible while the type stays fair.
- **7 mixed loans, 3 officers**: each type stays balanced separately while the total workload is kept as even as possible.

## Notes
- The browser entrypoint now lives at `src/app/index.html`; `LendingFair Launcher.html` is the user-facing launcher at the repository root.
- Default branding assets live under `src/branding/`.
- Loan officer names must be unique so totals display correctly.
- Amount Requested must be a valid non-negative number for every entered loan.
- Folder selection and direct PDF saving require a browser with the File System Access API.
- The CSV running-totals file is stored in the active `YYYY-MM` subfolder under the selected output folder and is reused the next time that folder is selected during that month.
- No install is needed.
- This runs fully in the browser and can be shared as files.

## Windows shortcut helper
- `scripts/Open LendingFair.cmd` opens the app using the repo-relative path to `src/app/index.html`.
- `scripts/Create Desktop Shortcut.vbs` creates a Desktop shortcut named `LendingFair` that points to that launcher script.
- For non-technical Windows users, the cleanest rollout is: unzip the folder, run `scripts/Create Desktop Shortcut.vbs` once, then launch LendingFair from the Desktop shortcut.

## Product tiers / entitlement foundation
- LendingFair now has internal support for Basic, Pro, and Platinum tiers through a centralized entitlement layer.
- Basic means consumer-loan assignment only using the Global fairness engine. Auto, Personal, Credit Card, and Collateralized are treated as consumer loans. Basic uses manual loan entry only and does not include file import or simulation.
- Pro unlocks mortgage loans, multiple officer roles, Officer Lane Fairness, file-based loan import, and fairness simulation up to 60 business days.
- Platinum is currently the default tier so all existing behavior remains available while productization continues, including unlimited simulation subject to existing input validation. Future live LOS/LMS integrations remain a Platinum architecture direction.
- The entitlement layer is wired into UI controls, run validation, PDF/report sections, and advanced testing tools.
- An **Internal Tier Mode** selector is available only as a temporary testing control for Basic, Pro, and Platinum behavior.
- Basic/Pro customer pilots use an offline local license file for pilot, monthly, or annual access. No online activation or payment processing is implemented.
- Future licensing can hydrate the current tier through the entitlement layer to unlock the right capabilities.

## Customer packaging mode
- LendingFair can now be packaged in customer mode with `window.LENDINGFAIR_CUSTOMER_CONFIG` or `src/config/customerConfig.js`.
- Customer mode can package the app for Basic, Pro, or Platinum; an installed local license is authoritative for the active tier in customer mode.
- Development mode preserves the current Platinum default and keeps the **Internal Tier Mode** selector available for testing.
- Customer mode hides internal tier controls, hides demo/dev-only controls by default unless explicitly enabled, and hydrates the tier from customer config.
- A customer-safe product label such as `LendingFair Basic` or `LendingFair Pro` is shown in customer mode, with optional customer name display.

## Offline pilot licenses
- Basic/Pro pilots can be issued as local license files for 30-day, 60-day, monthly, or annual windows.
- The installed license is stored as `lendingfair-license.json` in the selected working folder root, so another authorized user can use the same license by selecting the same working folder.
- Users renew by choosing **Update License** and pasting the license text provided by LendingFair or importing a LendingFair license file. LendingFair overwrites `lendingfair-license.json`; this is local-only and does not contact a server. The app validates the installed license locally to determine tier and expiration.
- In customer mode, missing, invalid, or expired licenses block new operational actions such as assignments, imports, officer edits, loan type edits, simulations, and new report generation.
- Expiration does not delete local data. Folder selection, support export, license renewal, and existing local files remain available for review/support.

## Release/version metadata
- Customer pilots include a visible app version and active tier in the UI.
- Generated assignment, EOM, custom, and simulation reports include app version, active tier, release channel, generated timestamp, and fairness engine metadata for audit/support.
- Current pilot version metadata is maintained in `src/config/appMetadata.js`.

## Support export
- The app includes a local-only **Export Support Package** action for Basic, Pro, and Platinum pilots.
- The export downloads a JSON package with app metadata, active tier, selected fairness engine, expected month files, missing-file notes, and generated report filenames when available.
- The package may include loan IDs, officer names, and assignment history, so it should only be shared with authorized support contacts.
- See `docs/customer/SUPPORT_EXPORT.md` for customer-facing guidance.

## Teams / SharePoint hosting notes
- If this app is opened *inside* a SharePoint/Teams page frame, folder-picker APIs may be blocked by browser/embed security settings.
- Recommended flow: open the app directly in Edge/Chrome (not embedded), then select a local OneDrive-synced folder that maps to the SharePoint document library.
- For true direct save to SharePoint without local folder selection, this app would need Microsoft Graph integration (authentication + upload API calls), which is not implemented in this local-file version.

## Graph auth/upload stub (for IT integration planning)
- A starter scaffold is included in `src/integrations/graph-sharepoint-stub.js`.
- The stubs expose `window.loanRandomizerGraphStubs` with:
  - `buildGraphDriveUploadUrl(...)`
  - `getGraphIntegrationChecklist()`
  - `getAccessTokenWithPkceStub()`
  - `uploadFileToSharePointStub(...)`
- This scaffold is intentionally non-functional for production auth/upload. It is a safe handoff point for IT/dev teams to wire tenant-specific Microsoft Graph auth and library upload logic.
- For a non-programmer rollout checklist, use `docs/GRAPH-SETUP.md`.


## New history and PDF features
- Generated PDFs now include a Fairness Audit section.
- Generated PDFs now include every officer's running totals for that run.
- Loan application number and IDs are tracked in `loan-randomizer-loan-history.csv`.
- A loan cannot be entered again in a later session if it already exists in loan history.
- A **Remove Loan Application** button lets the user remove a loan from history when needed.
